# My own patched version of dwl
[dwl](https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl) is a wlroots-based Wayland compositor inspired by
suckless.org's [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/). It's designed to be a very small and for you to
hack on; configuration is done by modifying the source code.

This repo is a fork of `dwl`, with the patches I like applied to it, including some of my own.

The scripts directory in the project contains some shell scripts that my patched version calls to
perform certain functions. Place these in your `~/.local/bin` directory and make sure they have
execute permissions.

TODO: Add build instructions lmao
